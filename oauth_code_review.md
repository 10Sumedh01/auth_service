OAuth Service Project Review
===========================

Feature-by-Feature Checklist
----------------------------

1. OAuth2 Core Endpoints
   - /authorize: ❌ Not present (critical for OAuth2 Authorization Code flow)
   - /token: ❌ Not present (critical for exchanging code for token)
   - /userinfo: ❌ Not present (should return user info for a valid token)
   - /revoke: ❌ Not present (for token revocation)
   - /introspect: ❌ Not present (for resource servers to validate tokens)
   - OAuth Social login: ✅ (partial, only GitHub/Google, and only as a direct login, not full OAuth2 spec)

2. Client (Application) Management
   - Register new OAuth clients: ✅ (via dashboard, App model)
   - Update/delete client applications: ✅ (delete via dashboard, update not clear)
   - List client applications: ✅ (dashboard)
   - Assign allowed grant types/scopes: ❌ (no scopes or grant type management)

3. User Management
   - User registration (sign up): ✅ (credentials, magic link, OAuth)
   - User login (sign in): ✅ (credentials, magic link, OAuth)
   - Password reset: ❌ (not implemented)
   - Email verification: ❌ (not implemented)
   - User profile endpoint: ❌ (not present as an API)

4. Consent & Scopes
   - Consent screen: ❌ (not present; users are not prompted to approve scopes)
   - Scope management: ❌ (no scopes in models or flows)

5. Token Management
   - Issue access tokens: ✅ (JWT via SimpleJWT)
   - Issue refresh tokens: ✅ (but not exposed in API)
   - Token revocation: ❌ (no endpoint to revoke tokens)
   - Token introspection: ❌ (no endpoint for resource servers)

6. Social Login
   - Google/GitHub login: ✅ (via OAuthConfig, but not as a full OAuth2 provider)

7. Admin & Dashboard
   - Admin interface: ✅ (Django admin, dashboard for apps/users)
   - Developer dashboard: ✅ (basic, for app/user management)

8. Security
   - Secure storage of secrets: ⚠️ (client_secret stored in DB, but not encrypted)
   - CSRF protection: ⚠️ (Django default, but not checked for API endpoints)
   - HTTPS enforcement: ❌ (not enforced in code)
   - Rate limiting: ❌ (not present)
   - Logging/audit: ❌ (not present)

9. Documentation
   - API documentation: ❌ (not present)

10. Testing
   - Unit/integration tests: ❌ (no tests in tests.py)

------------------------------------------------------------

Code Review & Suggestions
-------------------------

Models (models.py)
------------------
- App, User, ApiKey, OAuthConfig: Good structure for multi-tenant auth.
- User model: You are shadowing Django’s built-in User model. This can cause confusion and bugs. Consider renaming to AppUser or similar.
- Password storage: You use Django’s make_password, which is good.
- ApiKey: Good for app-level authentication.
- OAuthConfig: Good for storing per-app OAuth provider configs.
- Missing: No model for OAuth2 clients (for third-party apps to register and use your service as an OAuth provider), no model for scopes or consent.

Views (views.py in auth_api)
----------------------------
- API Key Authentication: Good custom class.
- OAuth Redirect/Callback: Only supports GitHub/Google, and only as a login method, not as a full OAuth2 provider (i.e., your service is a client, not a provider).
- Credentials/Magic Link: Good, but magic link is insecure (token is a JWT, can be used by anyone who gets the link).
- JWT Issuance: You use SimpleJWT, but you don’t expose refresh tokens or allow token revocation.
- No /authorize or /token endpoints: These are required for your service to act as an OAuth2 provider (like Auth0/NestAuth).
- No consent screen: Users are not prompted to approve scopes.
- No scopes: No way to request or limit access to user data.
- No password reset or email verification: These are standard for user management.
- No userinfo endpoint: No way for clients to fetch user profile with a token.
- No token introspection/revocation: No way for resource servers to validate/revoke tokens.

Dashboard (views.py in auth_service)
------------------------------------
- App/user management: Good, basic CRUD.
- Security: Deletion requires password and app name confirmation, which is good.
- No audit/logging: No logs for admin actions.

URLs
----
- API endpoints: Only basic auth endpoints are exposed.
- No endpoints for client registration, scopes, or OAuth2 provider flows.

------------------------------------------------------------

Key Missing Features for a True OAuth2 Provider (like NestAuth/Auth0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. OAuth2 Provider Endpoints
   - /authorize (user login/consent, returns code)
   - /token (exchange code for access/refresh token)
   - /userinfo (returns user info for access token)
   - /revoke (revoke tokens)
   - /introspect (validate tokens)

2. Consent & Scopes
   - Model and UI for scopes
   - Consent screen for users

3. Client Registration
   - Allow third-party apps to register as OAuth clients (get client_id/secret, set redirect URIs)

4. Security
   - Rate limiting, logging, enforce HTTPS, secure secret storage

5. User Management
   - Password reset, email verification

6. API Documentation
   - Swagger/OpenAPI or DRF docs

7. Testing
   - Add unit and integration tests

------------------------------------------------------------

Suggestions for Next Steps
--------------------------

1. Rename your custom User model to avoid confusion with Django’s built-in User.
2. Implement OAuth2 provider endpoints (see Django OAuth Toolkit).
3. Add consent and scope management.
4. Add user management features (password reset, email verification).
5. Add token revocation and introspection endpoints.
6. Add API documentation.
7. Add tests for all critical flows.
8. Consider using Django OAuth Toolkit to avoid reinventing the wheel for OAuth2 provider logic.
